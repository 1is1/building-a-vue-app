Understanding the layout of a Vue.js app is fairly straight forward but here is a few quick tips on where to
find different parts of your application. Your initial directory listing for the client should look like the
following.

If you need to change environment specific details you will fine those files located in the
`client/config` directory as well as module exports and the default running port number.

In addition to basic config files all of your actual application files that you will be building / editing
are located in the `client/src` directory.

Finally any testing files you may have will go in the `client/test` directory.
