Before we jump right into coding our client app lets take a quick overview of https://vuejs.org[Vue.js]. Vue.js is one of several
major Javascript frameworks in the market and is currently competing with and comparable to React and Angular.
It has its own ecosystem of plugins available to extend its functionality but works with npm like all the other
major players. Vue is sort of a middle ground between React and Angular but it is definitely more React-like as it
uses One-way data binding and requires you add things to your app as needed, not as much stuff is built in as in
Angular. One stand out feature that Vue incorporates as it uses vanilla HTML and CSS when writing pages so in that
aspect there is no learning curve. To read more on Vue.js check out their great documentation
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/[here] and for general info on the framework https://vuejs.org/[here].
With that said lets get into building our client.
