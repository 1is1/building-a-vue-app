In this guide you are going to create Grails app using Vue.js as the view layer. We will be using the same
'Garage' application that we have built before in several of our other guides located
http://guides.grails.org/building-a-react-app/guide/index.html[here] and
http://guides.grails.org/vaadin-grails/guide/index.html[here] for additional reference.
