If you generated your app using the the Vue profile from the forge you can skip this step. If you created your
Vue.js application using the instructions found https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html[here] then you
will need to update your running port number as it will conflict with the server port. Switch your port from the
default `8080` to `3000` or choose your own port if you like, just make sure nothing is running on the port first.

[source, javascript]
./client/config/index.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/config/index.js[indent=0, tags=clientPort]

In addition to changing the port we need to add a few dependencies to our application as we are making use of
the new Bootstrap v4 as a test run. Add the following dependencies to `package.json` in the `devDependencies`
block.

[source, json]
./client/package.json
----
"bootstrap-vue": "^0.20.1",
"bootstrap": "^4.0.0-alpha.6",
"style-loader": "^0.18.2",
