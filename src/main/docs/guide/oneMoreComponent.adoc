We are almost done creating new components but we have one more convenience component to create. Go ahead and
create the final component `VehicleDisplay`, this is almost the same as the components we created in
<<displayComponents>> except we including a sub-component.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/client/src/components
$ touch VehicleDisplay.vue
----

Edit it to look like the following...

[source,javascript]
./client/src/components/VehicleDisplay.vue
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/components/VehicleDisplay.vue[]
----
<1> Include the sub-component of `FullTable` that we previously created.
