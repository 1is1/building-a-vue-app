Our API for our Vue.js application is now in place and if you generated your app using the the `Vue` profile
from the http://start.grails.org[forge] you can skip this step. If you are using our initial app or if you
generated your grails application using the `rest-api` profile you will need to enable CORS in the
`grails-app/conf/application.yml`.
