Since we are already looking at the client side configuration lets finish getting that out of the way. Create
a `config` folder under `client/src`.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/client/src
$ mkdir config
----

Next create a `config.js`

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/client/src/config
$ touch config.js
----

Now that we have our last config file in place go ahead and make the following changes to it.

[source, javascript]
./client/src/config/config.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/config/config.js[]
----

This constant of our server url will be used to avoid duplicate code in our app and will make it easy in the
future to change the url if necessary.
