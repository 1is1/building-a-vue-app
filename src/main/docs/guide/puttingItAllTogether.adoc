Now that everything is in place we are finally ready to tie it all together. Back in <<vueConfig>> we said we
would return to our `App.vue` that Vue.js creates for us.

[source,javascript]
./client/src/App.vue
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.vue[]
----
<1> Import all of our components.
<2> Inform our top level component about all our other imported components.

As you see our top level component of `App` is just a collection of all our other components that we have
already built.

[source,html]
----
<app-header></app-header>
<vehicle-add-header></vehicle-add-header>
<vehicle-add></vehicle-add>
<vehicle-display></vehicle-display>
----

Return to <<runningTheApp>> and run the app and you should see the following page.
