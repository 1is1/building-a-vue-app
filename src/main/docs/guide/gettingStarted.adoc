In this guide you are going to create Grails app using https://vuejs.org[Vue.js] as the view layer. We will be using the same
`Garage` application that we have built before in several of our other guides;
http://guides.grails.org/building-a-react-app/guide/index.html[Building a React App] and
http://guides.grails.org/vaadin-grails/guide/index.html[Build a Grails 3 application with the Vaadin 8 Framework].
